Using DUAL simplex for phase 1 and PRIMAL simplex for phase 2.
The primal and dual simplex pricing strategy set to 'Devex'.
 
Found feasibility by dual simplex after             1 iter.
 
Optimal solution               -80.9 after          3 iter.

Excellent numeric accuracy ||*|| = 4.54747e-013

 MEMO: lp_solve version 5.5.2.0 for 64 bit OS, with 64 bit REAL variables.
      In the total iteration count 3, 0 (0.0%) were bound flips.
      There were 2 refactorizations, 0 triggered by time and 0 by density.
       ... on average 1.5 major pivots per refactorization.
      The largest [LUSOL v2.2.1.0] fact(B) had 8 NZ entries, 1.0x largest basis.
      The constraint matrix inf-norm is 4000, with a dynamic range of 634.921.
      Time to load data was 0.000 seconds, presolve used 0.000 seconds,
       ... 0.000 seconds in simplex solver, in total 0.000 seconds.
